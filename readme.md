# meetup_ical_export


This script will find all the meetup groups you're a part of, and take all of their events and export them in ical format so you can subscribe to a rolling calendar of meetup events that you might be interested in.

But now you don't have to go on meetup.com or say that you're going ahead of time. :)

## setup

### meetup api key
Just export your meetup API key as `MEETUP_KEY`.

### python depenencies
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### run the script
```
$ python script.py
```
